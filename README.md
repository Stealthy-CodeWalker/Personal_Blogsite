Needed to do something before I went bonkers due to absence of new books to read so I decided to let's chuck it and do bootstrap again

This project has been bootstrapped with Vite. Use the run command "npm run dev" to run it in your host.

Stack used:
1. ReactJS
2. Bootstrap 5

Will update as the project scales up
